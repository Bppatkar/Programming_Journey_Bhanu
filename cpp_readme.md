## How to Use

1. **Start Small**: Begin with Assignment 1 and gradually move to advanced assignments.
2. **Write Code**: Solve each question by writing and testing code in your favorite C compiler (e.g., GCC, Turbo C).
3. **Debug and Practice**: Test edge cases, improve your logic, and ensure you understand each solution.
4. **Track Progress**: Mark questions as completed to stay organized.

## Prerequisites

To complete these assignments, you need a basic understanding of:

- C syntax and structure
- Variables and data types
- Input/output functions (printf, scanf)
- Operators (arithmetic, relational, bitwise)
- Conditional statements and loops

## Goals

By completing these assignments, you will:

- Gain a solid understanding of C programming concepts.
- Build a strong foundation for solving programming problems.
- Improve logical thinking and debugging skills.

## Recommended Tools
