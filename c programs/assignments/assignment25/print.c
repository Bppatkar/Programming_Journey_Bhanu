// TODO: Assignment-25: Pointers

//! 1. Write a function to swap values of two int variables. (TSRN)


//! 2. Write a function to search all occurrences of a given character in a given string.
// The result of the search is a list of indices to be stored in the given array.
// [void search_all_occurrences(char *str, char ch, int *arr);]

//! 3. Write a function to convert a given string into uppercase.

//! 4. Write a function to convert a given string into lowercase.

//! 5. Write a function to extract a substring from a given string with specified start index (inclusive) and end index (exclusive),
// and store the extracted string in another char array.
// [void extract_string(char *str, int start_index, int end_index, char *result);]

//! 6. Write a function to swap strings of two char arrays.

//! 7. Write a function to sort an array of int type values.
// [void sort(int *ptr, int size);]

//! 8. Write a function to merge two arrays into a given array.
// [void merge(int *arr1, int size1, int *arr2, int size2, int *arr3);]

//! 9. Write a function to move the first value of the array to the position where all smaller values will be on the left
// and greater values will be on the right.

//! 10. There are five classes with a different number of students in them.
// Five arrays contain marks of students of each class.
// Write a function to receive an address of an array of pointers to access marks of all the students.
// The job of the function is to find the highest marks among all the classes.
