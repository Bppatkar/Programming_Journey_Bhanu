// TODO: Assignment-27: DMA

//! 1. Define a function to input a variable length string and store it in an array without memory wastage.

//! 2. Write a program to ask the user to input the number of data values they would like to enter,
// then create an array dynamically to accommodate the data values. Now take the input from the user
// and display the average of the data values.

//! 3. Write a program to calculate the sum of n numbers entered by the user using malloc and free.

//! 4. Write a function to merge two array elements and store them in a dynamically created array.
// Return the address of this dynamically created array.

//! 5. Define a structure Student with name, roll number, and college name as members.
// Define another structure Team with two Student type variables as members.

//! 6. In question 5, define a method to dynamically create a Student type variable and initialize it with
// the values received in the arguments. Return the address of the Student type variable.

//! 7. In question 5, define a method to dynamically create a Team variable,
// initialize it with the received arguments. Return the address of the Team variable.

//! 8. In question 5, define a method to display data of Student type,
// also define a method to display data of Team type.

//! 9. In question 5, define a method to dynamically create an array of pointers of type Student.
// The array size is received as an argument. Return the address of the array.

//! 10. In question 5, define a method to dynamically create an array of pointers of type Team.
// The array size is received as an argument. Return the address of the array.

//! 11. In question 5, define a driver function to create 6 Students and 3 Teams.
// Form teams by assigning two students to each team. At last, display the list of teams with students in them.
