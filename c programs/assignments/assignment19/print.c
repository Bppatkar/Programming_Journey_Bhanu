// TODO: Assignment-19: Arrays and Functions

//! 1. Write a function to find the greatest number from the given array of any size. (TSRS)

//! 2. Write a function to find the smallest number from the given array of any size. (TSRS)

//! 3. Write a function to sort an array of any size. (TSRN)

//! 4. Write a function to rotate an array by n position in d direction.
// The d is an indicative value for left or right.
// For example, if array of size 5 is [32, 29, 40, 12, 70]; n is 2 and d is left, then the resulting array after left rotation 2 times is [40, 12, 70, 32, 29].

//! 5. Write a function to find the first occurrence of adjacent duplicate values in the array.
// Function has to return the value of the element.

//! 6. Write a function to swap two elements of a given array with specified indices.

//! 7. Write a function to count a total number of duplicate elements in an array.
// (Means elements that occur 2 times in an array)

//! 8. Write a function to print all unique elements in an array.

//! 9. Write a function to merge two arrays of the same size sorted in descending order.

//! 10. Write a function to count the frequency of each element of an array.
