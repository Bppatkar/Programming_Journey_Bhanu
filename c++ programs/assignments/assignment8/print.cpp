// TODO: C++ Assignment 8

//! TODO: Assignment-36: Operator Overloading, friend operator

//! 1. Define a class Complex and overload following operators as a friend,
// 1. +
// 2. -
// 3. *

//! 2. Define a class Time with appropriate instance variables and member functions. Overload following operators
// 1. << insertion operator
// 2. >> extraction operator

//! 3. In Question-2, over load operator= to perform copy of Time object.

//! 4. Consider the following class Array
/* class Array
{
int *p;
int size;
public:
// methods
}
Define operator = to perform deep copy of Array objects. */

//! 5. In Question 4, define a friend operator to concatenate two Array objects.

//! 6. In Question-1, provide a unary friend operator to negate the real and imaginary part of a complex number.

//! 7. Define a class Integer with instance variable of type int. Provide a friend logical operator not I. Also define a friend operator == to compare two Integer objects.

//! 8. Create a Coordinate class with 2 instance variables x and y. Overload comma operator such that when you write c3 = (c1, c2) then c2 is assigned to c3. Where c1, c2,and c3 are objects of 3D coordinate class.

//! 9. In Question-8, provide overloaded insertion and extraction operators.

//! 10. Define a class Student with roll no, name and age as instance variables. Create setStudent() and showStudent() methods in the class. Overload operator == to compare two Student objects.
