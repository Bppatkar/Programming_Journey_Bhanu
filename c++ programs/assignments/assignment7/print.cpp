// TODO: C++ Assignment 6

//! TODO: Assignment-34: constructor

//! 1. Define a class Cuboid with length, breadth and height as instance member variables. Define constructors to initialise member variables.

//! 2. Define a class Customer with instance members customer_id, name, email, mobile. Define non parameterized constructor and parameterized constructor in the class.

//! 3. Define a class Time with hr,min, se√ß as instance member variables. Define constructor to initialise time object.

//! 4. Define a class Book with booked, title and price as instance member variables. Define non parameterized and parameterized constructor in the class.

//! 5. Define a class Complex with instance variables for real and imaginary part of a complex number. Define only one parameterized constructor in the class to initialise complex object. Also define showData method in the class to display object data Now create an array of Complex class with size 5 and display values of each object

//! 6. Define a class Numbers with size and arr pointer as instance variables. Provide constructor to initialise instance members, dynamically allocate an array of given size and store address in arr variable of object. Also define destructor to deallocate memory of array. Implement deep copy using copy constructor to avoid memory issues

//! 7. Define a class student and write a program to enter student details using constructor and define member function to display all the details.

//! 8. Define a class Date with d, m, y as instance variables. Initialise members using initializers.

//! 9. Define a class Room for a hotel management project with room number, room type, is_AC, price as instance variables. Initialise instance variables using constructor.

//! 10. Define Circle class with radius as instance variable. Define two constructors in the class -non parameterized and parameterized.
