// TODO: Assignment-33: Member function, static

//! 1. Define a class Complex to represent a complex number with instance variables a and b to store real and imaginary parts. Also define following member functions
//! 1. void setData(int, int)
//! 2. void showData()
//! 3. Complex add(Complex)
//! 4. Complex subtract(Complex)
//! 5. Complex multiply(Complex)

//! 2. Define a class Time to represent a time with instance variables him and sec to store hour, minute, and second. Also define following member functions
//! 1. void setTime(int, int, int)
//! 2. void showTime()
//! 3. void normalize()
//! 4. Time add(Time)
//! 5. bool isGreater(Time)

//! 3. Define a class TestResult with properties roll_no, right, wrong, net_score. Also define class properties right_weightage, wrong_weightage. Provide methods to set and get all the properties.

//! 4. Write a driver function main() to use TestResult class (Question 3). Create an array of 5 TestResult objects, set values to all the objects and display the results in sorted order (by net_score).

//! 5. Define a class Matrix to represent a 3x3 order matrix. Provide appropriate methods and properties to the class. Also define following methods in the class:
//! 1. Matrix add(Matrix)
//! 2. Matrix sub(Matrix)
//! 3. Matrix multiply(Matrix)
//! 4. Matrix transpose()
//! 5. bool is_singular()
