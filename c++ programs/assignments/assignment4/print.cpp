//! 1. Define a class Complex to represent a complex number. Declare instance member variables to store real and imaginary part of a complex number. Also define instance member functions to set values of complex number and print values of complex number.

//! 2. Define a class Time to represent Time (like 3 hr 45 min 20 sec). Declare appropriate number of instance member variables and also define instance member functions to set values for time and display values of time.

//! 3. Define a class Date to represent date (like d=31, m=12, y=2022). Declare appropriate number of instance member variables and also define instance member functions to set date and get date.

//! 4. In question 3, define methods to display date in the following pattern:
//!    1. 31-12-2022
//!    2. 31-Dec-2022

//! 5. Define a class Circle with radius as its property. Provide setRadius() and getRadius() methods. Also define methods to return area and circumference of the circle.
