// TODO: C++ Assignment 7

//! TODO: Assignment-35: operator overloading

//! 1. Define a class Complex with appropriate instance variables and member functions. Define following operators in the class:

//! 1. +
//! 2. -
//! 3. *
//! 4. ==

//! 2. Create a class Time which contains hour, min and second as fields. Overload greater than. (>) operator to compare two time objects.

//! 3. In Question-2, overload pre-increment and post-increment operator to increment Time object value by one second.

//! 4. In Question-2, overload operator+ to add two Time objects.

//! 5. Define a class matrix to represent 3x3 matrix. Provide appropriate instance methods. Also define operator +, operator-, operator* to perform addition, subtraction and multiplication operations respectively.

//! 5. Consider following class Numbers
/* class Numbers

{
    int x, y, z;

public:
    // methods
}; */

//! Overload the operator unary minus(-) to negate the numbers.

//! 6. Define a C++ class fraction
/* class fraction

{

long numerator,

    long denominator,

    public :

    fraction(long n = 0, long d = 0);
}

Define an operator+ to add two fraction object. */

//! 7. In Question -6,define an operator<to compare two fraction objects.

//! 8. Consider a class Distance

/* class Distance

{

    int km, m, cm;

public:
    // methods,
};

Overload the operator+ to add two distance objects. */

//! 9. In Question - 8, define operator pre decrement and post decrement to decrease distance by 1 cm.

//! 10. Consider the following class Array

/* class Array
{
    int *p;

    int size;

public:
    // methods
};

Define constructor to allocate an array of given size(size is given through parameter).

Define a subscript operator to access element at given Index.Define destructor to deallocates the memory of array.
